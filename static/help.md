You can edit everything, without registration. (But if you delete everything, I'll roll it back and then make a voodoo doll of you and stick some needles into it).

The most important rule is: **it's collaborative notes, not Wikipedia**. In other words, incomplete entries like this are welcome here:

> **pros:** pretty nice API\
> **cons:** buggy (see an example on my Github, here's the link)

Some additional guidelines/observations/etc that probably make sense:

  * sort pros/cons by importance

  * if you don't like something for any reason, edit it

  * if you're unsure about something, still write it (just warn others that you're unsure)

  * if you have useful information of any kind that doesn't fit, add it to the category notes
