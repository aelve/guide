<h1>Donate</h1>

<p>Okay, the rules: if you donate <i>anything</i>, I'll spend some time working on the site this day (adding content, implementing new features, etc). Of course, I'm planning to be working on the site anyway, donations or not! However, I jump from project to project way too often (and rarely manage to finish anything), so donating money is a good way to make sure that I'd feel obligated to keep working on this one. If I find out that it doesn't work as a motivation, I'll stop accepting donations.</p>

<p>Just in case, 1000 rub. is 14$ (or 12.5€), and you can choose any amount below 15000 rub. I'd put a Paypal button, but Paypal doesn't allow receiving money in Belarus.</p>

(By the way, if you <a href="https://artyom.me/cv">hired me</a>, it'd be even better!)
