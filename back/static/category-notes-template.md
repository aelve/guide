Something about the category.

# Recommendations

Say what everyone is using and what you recommend/don't recommend. Sort of a “tl;dr” for the category.

# Not included

Say what items aren't included (and give reasons). For instance, “X isn't included because it's worse than the alternatives, Y isn't included because it doesn't build with recent GHC”, etc.
